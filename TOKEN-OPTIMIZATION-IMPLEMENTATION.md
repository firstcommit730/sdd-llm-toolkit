## What Was Implemented

### 1. Modular Constitution Structure

Created `.specify/templates/constitution/` with 7 focused section files:

| Section           | File               | Size          | Purpose                                        | Priority |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| **Core**          | `core.md`          | ~3,500 tokens | Technology stack, coding standards, linting    | Critical |
| **Testing**       | `testing.md`       | ~2,800 tokens | Test organization, coverage, security testing  | Critical |
| **Security**      | `security.md`      | ~1,200 tokens | Security principles, auth, data protection     | Critical |
| **Observability** | `observability.md` | ~3,200 tokens | Logging, metrics, tracing                      | High     |
| **Architecture**  | `architecture.md`  | ~2,500 tokens | Architectural principles, API design, database | High     |
| **Operations**    | `operations.md`    | ~1,800 tokens | Versioning, feature toggles, dependencies      | Medium   |
| **Optional**      | `optional.md`      | ~800 tokens   | Documentation, glossary, roadmap               | Low      |

**Plus**: Branching standards remain in `.specify/memory/branching-standards.md` (loaded separately)

---

## 2. Smart Loading Script

Created `.specify/scripts/bash/load-constitution.sh` with:

### Project Type Presets

```bash
# Usage: load-constitution.sh <preset>

backend   # Loads: core, testing, security, observability, architecture, branching
frontend  # Loads: core, testing, architecture, optional, branching
infra     # Loads: core, operations, security, observability, branching
core      # Loads: core, branching (minimal)
testing   # Loads: testing, branching
full      # Loads: all sections (use sparingly)
```

### Explicit Section Loading

```bash
# Usage: load-constitution.sh "section1,section2,section3"
load-constitution.sh "core,testing,security"
```

---

## 3. Prompt Updates

### Specify Prompt (`prompts/specify.md`)

**Strategy**: Project-type-based loading

**Implementation**:

- Loads constitutional sections based on feature type (backend, frontend, infra)
- Default: `backend` preset
- **Token Usage**: ~12,000 tokens

**Usage**:

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/load-constitution.sh backend
```

---

### Plan Prompt (`prompts/plan.md`)

**Strategy**: Targeted section loading for planning

**Implementation**:

- Loads only planning-relevant sections: `core,architecture,testing,branching`
- Focuses on design and technical planning standards
- **Token Usage**: ~10,000 tokens

**Usage**:

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/load-constitution.sh "core,architecture,testing,branching"
```

---

### Tasks Prompt (`prompts/tasks.md`)

**Strategy**: Context-aware loading based on task type

**Implementation**:

- Detects task type from plan and artifacts
- Loads appropriate sections:
  - **Testing tasks**: `testing,branching`
  - **API/service tasks**: `core,architecture,security,branching`
  - **Infrastructure tasks**: `core,operations,security,branching`
  - **Mixed tasks**: `core,testing,architecture,branching`
- **Token Usage**: ~5,000 tokens

**Dynamic Loading**:

```bash
# Determined at runtime based on task analysis
.specify/scripts/bash/load-constitution.sh "<detected-sections>"
```

---

### Implement Prompt (`prompts/implement.md`)

**Strategy**: Just-in-time loading per file type

**Implementation**:

- Loads sections based on file being implemented:
  - **Test files** (_.test._, _.spec._): `testing,branching`
  - **Services/handlers**: `core,architecture,observability,branching`
  - **Auth/security files**: `core,security,branching`
  - **Models/entities**: `core,architecture,branching`
  - **API/routes**: `core,architecture,security,branching`
  - **Config/deployment**: `operations,security,branching`
  - **Logging/monitoring**: `observability,branching`
- Re-loads when switching to different file types
- **Token Usage**: ~4,000 tokens per task

**File-Type Detection**:

```bash
# Detects from current task's target file
.specify/scripts/bash/load-constitution.sh "<file-type-sections>"
```

---

### Audit Prompt (`prompts/audit.md`)

**Strategy**: Progressive 3-phase loading

**Implementation**:

#### Phase 1 - Critical Compliance (Always)

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/load-constitution.sh "core,testing,security,branching"
```

- Covers most common issues
- **Token Usage**: ~8,000 tokens

#### Phase 2 - Deep Dive (If Issues Found)

```bash
# Load only if specific issues detected in Phase 1
load-constitution.sh "architecture"     # If architectural issues
load-constitution.sh "observability"    # If logging issues
load-constitution.sh "operations"       # If deployment issues
```

- **Token Usage**: ~12,000-15,000 tokens

#### Phase 3 - Comprehensive (If Score < 80%)

```bash
# Load remaining sections for thorough review
load-constitution.sh "optional"
```

- **Token Usage**: ~18,000-20,000 tokens

**Adaptive**: High-quality implementations use minimal tokens; problematic code gets thorough review.

## Usage Guide

### For Prompt Authors

When writing new prompts, use the loading script with appropriate strategy:

**Simple Static Loading**:

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/load-constitution.sh "core,testing,branching"
```

**Preset Loading**:

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/load-constitution.sh backend
```

**Dynamic Loading** (in your prompt logic):

```bash
# Detect context
if [[ "$file" == *.test.* ]]; then
  SECTIONS="testing,branching"
elif [[ "$file" == *service* ]]; then
  SECTIONS="core,architecture,observability,branching"
else
  SECTIONS="core,branching"
fi

.specify/scripts/bash/load-constitution.sh "$SECTIONS"
```

---

### For Constitution Authors

When updating constitution:

1. **Identify the section**: Determine which modular file to update
2. **Update the file**: Edit the appropriate `.specify/templates/constitution/*.md`
3. **Update metadata**: Keep token count and version current in file header
4. **Test loading**: Verify the script loads the updated section correctly

**Section Metadata Format**:

```markdown
<!--
Section: core
Tokens: ~3500
Priority: critical
Applies to: all projects
Dependencies: []
Version: 1.0.0
-->
```

---

## Monitoring & Metrics

Track effectiveness by:

1. **Token usage per prompt**: Monitor actual token consumption
2. **Cache hit rates**: Track how often sections are reused
3. **Audit phase distribution**: See how often Phase 2/3 are needed
4. **Response times**: Measure speed improvements

Consider adding to `.specify/scripts/bash/common.sh`:

```bash
track_tokens() {
  echo "$(date),${1},${2},${3}" >> .specify/metrics/token-usage.csv
}
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Section Caching**: Cache loaded sections in memory for multiple operations
2. **Smart Dependencies**: Auto-load dependent sections (e.g., security needs core)
3. **Version Pinning**: Support loading specific section versions
4. **Custom Combinations**: Allow projects to define custom preset combinations
5. **Token Tracking Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of token usage

### Template Evolution

As constitution grows:

- Split large sections further if they exceed 3,000 tokens
- Create specialized sections for emerging patterns
- Update presets to include new sections as needed
